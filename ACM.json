The arrow cannot embed itself in a creature that does not have organic flesh, such as most constructs, elementals, and oozes.

On a failed save, the target gains one level of {@condition exhaustion}.",

				"Whenever the arrow is removed from a creature or its corpse, roll a {@dice d20}. On a 1, the arrow snaps and crumbles to dust, forever destroyed."
